    <p> This year's grand tour, <strong>which is the first one in the series of more to come</strong>, will feature two rather odd fellows who will be traversing through various terrains of Baku, Azerbaijan, to reach the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/rYZpV2Pi5EQRSCX67" target="_blank">beach</a> located at the other end of the world. The <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/59pth3DZRvS2gQ9J7" target="_blank">starting point</a> of this ludicrous, albeit absolutely fantastical, journey is everyone's favorite (!!! NOT SPONSORED !!!) Bravo Hypermarket, so these lads will have to travel all the way to the White Boulevard and gradually make their way to the final destination from there. But... as you might have already guessed,<strong> THERE'S A CATCH!</strong> There is a high chance that these poor souls will encounter Ali along the way, and he is surely going to make their journey <strong> a living hell. </strong> GUARANTEED!</p>
    <p> <strong>UPDATE 09/04/23:</strong> Well, we actually ran the demo version of this tour from Daniz Mall. Upon reaching the end of the boulevard, we realized that rolling down the highway was not an option... unless we got the timing right. With the help of traffic lights, the highway was ours for the taking. Of course, we did run into a few hurdles. For starters, we almost ended up mountaineering (crazy, right?). Past the ship yard, the highway, thanks to the shoulder, was ours yet again. By pushing, we managed to reach the beach before nightfall. Here, it's worth mentioning that this demo was initiated with a simple question: а может попробуем?</p>  
    <p> <strong>UPDATE 22/04/23:</strong> What the f*ck, man... What the f*ck are we doing in the Hazi Aslanov desert? Ah, yes! A rhetorical question. This time, we were travelling all the way from Hazi Aslanov to that very same beach in Shikhov. Man, was it hot out there! I mean, the heat was picking up crazy. Had we stayed there any longer, our bones would have been picked clean... To say that everything went according to the plan would be a shameless lie. Our desparate attempt at escaping the Hazi Aslanov highway ended up with us reaching a dead end in a deserted shanty town. After 5 minutes of processing our circumstances, we sucked it up and got back on track. Oh, and we also discovered an old factory along the way. Anyhow, you can find some of the highlights by pressing one of the buttons above. We'll be back.</p>
